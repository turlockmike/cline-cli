# Project Roadmap

## Voice Command Integration
- [ ] Implement voice prompt listener functionality
  - [ ] Add wake word detection ("Hey Hataraku")
  - [ ] Implement continuous background audio monitoring
  - [ ] Convert speech to text for command processing
  - [ ] Handle voice command errors gracefully

### Completion Criteria
- Wake word detection with high accuracy
- Successful conversion of voice to text commands
- Proper integration with existing command processing pipeline
- Error handling for unclear speech or background noise
- Performance optimization to minimize resource usage

### Technical Considerations
- Voice processing should be local for privacy and performance
- Need to handle different accents and languages
- Must work across different operating systems
- Should have minimal impact on system resources

## Completed Tasks
- Initial project setup
- Basic CLI functionality
- Text-based command processing

## Future Scalability
- Support for custom wake words
- Multi-language support
- Voice response capabilities
- Voice command shortcuts/aliases
