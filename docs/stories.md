## Acceptance Criteria Template
Each story should include:
- Detailed technical requirements
- Test scenarios
- Documentation requirements
- Performance requirements
- Migration considerations

## Priority and Dependencies
- High Priority (P0):
  - Agent Conversion (#1)
  - Tool Integration (#6, #7)
  - Core Documentation (#12)

- Medium Priority (P1):
  - Task Management (#4, #5)
  - CLI Updates (#8)
  - Testing (#14)

- Lower Priority (P2):
  - Advanced Features (#10, #11)
  - Additional Examples (#13)
  - Monitoring (#15)

## Timeline Considerations
- Phase 1: Core Conversion (Stories #1, #6, #7, #12)
- Phase 2: Essential Features (Stories #4, #5, #8, #14)
- Phase 3: Advanced Features (Stories #10, #11, #13, #15)

## Notes
- All implementations should maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Each story should include migration paths for existing users
- Documentation should be updated in parallel with implementation
- Testing should cover both happy path and error scenarios
- Performance impact should be considered for all changes
